# project-Arche-freight-logistics-system

A scalable freight management and logistics orchestration system.

## Project purpose

The Arche Freight Logistics System is a specialized platform designed to manage complex supply chain movements and freight orchestration. It provides a centralized hub for tracking shipments, managing carrier documentation, and optimizing cargo routing for international trade.
This project is a full-stack showcase of modern web architecture, utilizing a high-performance backend and a relational database to handle real-world logistics data. It focuses on data integrity, security, and a scalable API-first design.

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Backend:** Node.js (v22 LTS), Express.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub (feature branches with pull-request workflow)

## Current Status

**Day 1 – Setup:** Repository initialized with professional baseline, license, and initial project structure. Local development environment verified.

## Engineering Approach

The backend is designed with explicit separation of concerns, treating authentication, authorization, business logic, and infrastructure as independent system boundaries. Data integrity and security are enforced at multiple layers (database constraints, service validation, and middleware guards), with deliberate failure semantics and resilience under infrastructure outages. The system is built incrementally using production-oriented patterns rather than tutorial abstractions.
